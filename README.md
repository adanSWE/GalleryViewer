This is an Object Oriented Application that has a console based menu that the user can interact with.<br><br>
There are two packages:
- part01: this package is a simple console based menu to add, search, display information about image records.
- part02: this package uses a console external jar file (given by my professor) that is used to manipulate images and their records on a seperate console window.

ps: This coding project was a part of my University assessment for my Object-Oriented Programming module.<br><br>
